                    the Annapurna Base Camp trek. Mardi Himal trek is an unseen gem yet. Few trekkers make their way to the 
                    Mardi Himal Base Camp outstandingly positioned at the base of Mardi Himal and the Annapurna region´s most 
                    iconic mount Machapuchhre literally meaning "Fish tail". The trail goes along small winding paths, through 
                    enchanted rhododendron forests until you climb out of the forest at an elevation around 3,300 meter. <br> <br>
                    The landscape changes quite abruptly into a rugged high mountain landscape, with amazing views of 
                    Mardi Himal, Machapuchre, Annapurna South and Hiunchuli. From High Camp (3700m; some maps incorrectly 
                    mention 3900 m) you can climb up to Mardi Himal Base Camp in about 3-4 hours, which offers spectacular close 
                    up views of the entire Annapurna Range. There are simple guesthouses and homestays along the entire route.

                    The Langtang Valley has long been a favorite trek due to its expansive views, interesting Tamang 
                    culture, relatively gentle pace and accessibility from Kathmandu. The 2015 earthquake and subsequent 
                    andslide had an enormous effect on the region, but aid and reconstruction have recently reopened 
                    this valley to trekking again. Not only is it still a beautiful trek, your visit will also provide 
                    vital support for local livelihoods. <br> <br>
                    The Langtang trek is a trek with real heart. The Langtang Valley is one of the most beautiful places 
                    in Nepal and was once the darling of trekkers seeking stunning landscapes and authentic culture along
                    with heartwarming hospitality in delightful homestay guest houses — all within easy reach of 
                    Kathmandu. <br> <br>However, the Langtang Valley is almost devoid of visitors these days as the people of Langtang 
                    are continuing to rebuild their lives after the 2015 earthquake. Survivors of the landslides
                    caused by the earthquake were forced to leave the valley, but now they have come back to 
                    reclaim their homeland, rebuild their homes and re-establish their farms. <br> <br>
                    Trekking in this beautiful valley will support the people of Langtang by providing much-needed 
                    income to rebuild in a sustainable and secure way. This is not charity; this is the business 
                    end of sustainable travel, where your travel choices can respectfully support local people 
                    while preserving their dignity, their culture and their way of life. Be wowed by nature, be 
                    humbled by the human spirit and be a part of local solutions when you choose to trek in Langtang.
